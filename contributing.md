# Contributing Guidelines

- Add single resource in one pull request as it will allow for easier review.

- Pull request title should include a description of the resource.</br>

> Resource table format : 

| Author /Owner      | Source |Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| John Doe   | [Link text](https://twitter.com/home)        | A description        |


- Provide working links in the source column.
- It's recommended you submit resources that you personally have used and found useful, not just random googled resources for a positive impact to learners.
